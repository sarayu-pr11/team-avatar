        <h2>a little about me</h2>
        <p> hello! I'm Riya and I am a junior! Some of my favorite things to do are hang out with my friends, watch movies and play board games! One of the most random things I love to do is to solve an escape room - in real life or on a game :) I love marvel, harry potter and disney :) In the future, I would love to travel to Thailand, or Africa : those are the places I want to go the most! Here is a piture of me and my friend Aleezay at Disneyland! I'm on the right :) </p>
